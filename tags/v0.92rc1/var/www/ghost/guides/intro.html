<h2>Documentation & References</h2>
<p>These tutorials and further reading are meant as a educational modules to support this application. As you can see this site was developed with just about every web vulnerability all packed into a few pages. I would like to add that I tested this site, and did not reach an end to the vulnerabilities that I found even many that are not covered in this documentation. All code was tested in Windows XP with both I.E. and Firefox. If you have any questions, or comments please feel free to fill out the form located <a href="http://webdevelopmentsolutions.org/getInfo.php">Here </a>and I will get back to you as soon as possible. On my site there are links to many tools, security links, and some tutorials. There are many advanced techniques for web application hacking that are outside of the scope of this documentation, i suggest doing some research, google is your friend. Support documentation will be added to my site and updated regularly, along with video tutorials for further tool usage.</p>
