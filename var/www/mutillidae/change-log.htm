	<p>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.1.15:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Upgraded the "JavaScript Validation" for the dns-lookup.php page. The 
			JavaScript validation is only activated in security level 1. The new
			validation checks for cross-site scripting characters in addition to
			OS command injection characters.
			
			The validations are trivial to defeat by disabling JS in the browser 
			or using an interception proxy to bypass the validation.
		</li>
		<li>
			In security level 1, on page add-to-your-blog.php the CSRF token
			is now generated. The token is predictable although perhaps not
			obvious. The intention is for students to use Burp-Suite 
			sequencer to discover the pattern and inject the next token in
			the sequence (or to subtract each token from the last token).
		</li>
		<li>
			The CSRF token generator for the add-to-your-blog.php page is 
			now using the OWASP Randomizer to generate random tokens
			in security level 5. The previous generator used mt_random()
			which was not really random.
			
			These new tokens have an entropy of around 132 bits.

			Added lots of HTML5 attacks to the easter egg file Mutillidae-Test-Scripts.txt
		</li>
		<li>
			Added new page capture.php which captures any information sent to the page
			in GET or POST parameters and saves them to a database table. Can be used
			to capture cookies, session storage, local storage, or other data. The page is 
			designed to reflect the capture cookie page used in the SANS 542 Web Application
			Pen Testing course currently taught by Kevin Johnson of SecureIdeas.
			
			This page is designed to capture any parameters sent and store them in a file 
			and a database table. It loops through the POST and GET parameters and records 
			them to a file named captured-data.txt. On Windows system, the file should be 
			found at C:/xampp/htdocs/mutillidae/captured-data.txt. The page also tries to 
			store the captured data in a database table named captured_data. There is 
			another page named captured-data.php that attempts to list the contents of 
			this table.

			injectable to cause XSS. The menu item is located under OWASP Top 10 --&gt;
			A2 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) --&gt; Via HTTP Headers --&gt; Those BACK Buttons.
			Any page will do. I just picked one at random.

		<li>
			Added a new page pen-test-tool-lookup.php. This page is vulnerable to JSON injection.
			A large tutorial was added as well showing how to perform JavaScript XSS injection
			into the JSON data so that the XSS executes.
			To see the tutorial, click the HINTS button. As an exercise, the user is encouraged
			to perform a JSON string injection and an HTML injection after learning how to
			perform the XSS injection. The JSON has been carefully designed to make it relatively
			easier to get the JSON injection to work. JSON injection can be somewhat tricky 
			if a user has not tried it before and/or does not use JSON in web applications.
			The HINTS button is on the menu at the top of the screen.
			The page is also vulnerable to SQL injection, HTML injection, 
			and JSON string injection in addition to XSS.
		</li>
		<li>
			The next step will be to add defenses to pen-test-tool-lookup.php. There will
			be a level 1 defense and a level 5 defense. The level 1 will just be
			JavaScript validation. Level 5 defense will be more robust and
			hopefully difficult to defeat. This will be release 2.1.11 or later.

	<p>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.1.7:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added a new page for HTML5 storage. The page is meant to show how to both use 
			and attack HTML5 storage. The page supports Local and Session storage types.
			The user can attack the storage in two contexts. They can act as if they want 
			to read to contents of their own browsers session storage to see if the 
			developer put authorization tokens or other items into the storage.
			They can also try to use XSS to steal the session storage. In this use-case
			the user would be acting as if they wanted to read someone elses storage.
			A large number of hints has been added to the page. The page name is 
			"html5-storage.php" and can be accessed from the Cross Site Scripting menu
			and information leakage menu. In security level zero, the page has no defenses.
			In level 1, the page will use trivial JavaScript validation. In security level 5,
			the page will refuse to put the secrets in client side storage.

			can be used to find these pages. Mutillidae now has such a page. It is in the

		<li>
			Added a new security level. Now there is security level 1. The only difference
			in this release between level 0 and level 1 is that level 1 has JS validation.
			The JS validation has been in place for a while to allow but was activated in
			level 0. Since level 0 is supposed to be very easy, the decision was made
			to create level 1 and move JS validation to level 1. The JS validation is
			trivial to bypass. Simply disable JS or use a proxy such as Tamper Data,
			Paros, Burp, WebScarab, or others.

			Fixed error on page add to your blog. Input user was not escaped or encoded in secure mode.

		<li>
			Major change. The MYSQL connection has been changed from procedure mysql_ functions to using
			object oriented instances from the class mysqli. mysqli became available in PHP 5.3.0
			and is brand new to Mutillidae. There is a high chance of error. Please let me
			know if there are bugs found. This new class gives us many new abilities
			including the ability to call stored procedures without using concatenation. This 
			change affects the entire project and changes the capabilities of the project
			which is why the minor version was updated.
			
			All of the database code has been ripped out and replaced from the ground up. Next will
			be to add stored procedures and views to the database. When SQL injection is done on
			meta data, there will be many more targets. Users will be able to steal the source code
			from views and procs during pen tests along with dumping tables.

<blockquote>
	<p>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.8:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added more comments to the code to explain how defenses work</li>
		<li>
		Added support for the &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; tag to the blog. In secure mode Mutillidae will allow this tag
		but still safely encode output and stop XSS.</li>
		<li>
		Added JavaScript filtering to prevent single quotes from being entered in blog entries. This give practice 
		bypassing JavaScript "security" and helps the user understand JavaScript cannot provide security.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added lots of JS filtering to login.php. Nearly all characters are filtered. Users are encouraged
			to understand that JavaScript and filtering are useless for security.
		</li> 
		<li>Added autofocus to login.php and add-to-blog.php</li>
		<li>
			Added more "allowed dangerous HTML tags" to the blog. Until now only the bold HTML tag was supported. Also
			the output was not HTML5 compliant. For example, if the user entered a bold tag, then a bold tag was output
			however the bold tag is depreciated. Styles must be used. So Mutillidae allows the user to input
			a bold tag but will correctly encode this as a sytle upon output. The italic tag is now supported
			as a dangerous input which is safely output without fear of Cross Site Scripting. These defenses
			only operate in secure mode of course. In insecure mode, the site allows any input and simply outputs
			whatever is input without any encoding.
		</li>
		<li>
			Changed menu for OWASP A1 - Injection to differentiate between SQL, HTML, and Command Injection. This should make
			it more clear which pages exhibit vulnerabilities with the specific injecton sub-types. Also added new link for 
			Blind SQL Injection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Changed menu for OWASP A2 - Cross Site Scripting to differentiate between XSS coming in via user supplied fields 
			(GET/POST) and values within HTTP Request Headers.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added tutorials feature.
		</li>
		<li>Added SQL Injection Totorial</li>
		<li>Added Cross Site Scripting tutorial</li>
		<li>Added Command Injection tutorial</li>		
		<li>
			Added new feature. Hints can now be at different levels. Each time the user clicks Hints, the level increases by 1 until rolling over.
		</li>
		<li>Removed the installation instructions from the home page. A new page for instructions is created and linked from the menu.
		<li>
			Augmented the installation instructions to include running from Samurai, creating a custom ISO, installing 
			to XAMPP, and running in virutal machines.
		</li>
		<li>Reformatted install instructions and main home page to be compliant with HTML 5</li>

	<p>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.7:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added a new page rene-magritte.php to explore click-jacking.
			
			In secure mode, Mutillidae will send the X-FRAME-OPTIONS: DENY
			header. In modern browsers, this will cause the browser to throw an
			error rather than allow the page rene-magritte.php to be framed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added a resources link to the main menu. Links are to information
			or tools that can help with testing Mutillidae.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added new class LogHandler to take over logging. Previously
			logging statements has to be copied to each spot that logging
			was needed. With the new class, logging requires only one
			line of code and the logger automatically logs based on the 
			current security level. If in insecure mode, no attempt
			to stop XSS or SQLi is made.
			
			With the new class, many less lines of code are needed and many
			more places log. With more places logging, there is a much better
			chance of finding a log exploit and taking advantage (insecure mode).
			
			Logging added to pages: add-to-your-blog, dns-lookup, text-file-viewer,
			source-viewer.php, register.php, redirectandlog.php, and user-info.php
		</li>
		<li>
			Added more default users to initial setup to give more targets.

	<p>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.6:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added a new security vulnerability and counteracting secure code.
			The "business requirements" for the add-new-blog-entry page 
			now require users to be able to enter a bold tag
			in their blog.

			In secure mode, Mutillidae allows this functionality while still 
			protecting the users from mallicous injection input.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new secret page has been added. There are lots of test scripts
			that the developers used to hack Mutillidae inside. It will be very hard
			to guess the name of the file but there are plenty of vulns
			that will allow users to locate and open the file.

<blockquote>
	<p>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.6:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added a new security vulnerability and counteracting secure code.
			Cookies are unprotected in insecure mode, but in secure mode, the
			cookies will have the HTTPOnly attribute applied to them.
			
			In reality this vulnerability was always in Mutillidae since ignoring
			the issue opens the vulnerability (the ability for scripts to access the
			cookie values). The change is acknowleging this issue and adding the 
			defense. 
			
			Once we get an SSL certificate installed, the next logical step will be to 
			add the "Secure" attribute to cookies in secure mode, but to not
			add this attribute in insecure mode. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Added the X-FRAME-OPTIONS: DENY click-jacking defense in secure mode.
			In insecure mode, the site does nothing and ignores the issue entirely.
			This defense only works in newer browsers and javascript framebusters are
			needed to help older browsers.
		</li>
		<li>Added insecure comments vulnerability and defense. Some developers use 
			HTML or JavaScript comments instead of using the frameworks comments 
			(ASP.NET, Java, PHP, Etc.)
		</li>
		<li>Rearranged instructions on home page to emphasize the PHP.ini 
			configuration changes that are needed to get rid of errors.
		</li>
		<li>Rewrote opendb.inc to have error trapping and custom
			error handling. If there is an error, there will be some diagnistic
			information available.
		</li>

	<p>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.5:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			browser-info.php - Patched a bug which disabled entire page if the 
			whois server is not reachable. Now only that one line will be disabled.
			Also replaced Windows style file path slashes with Unix style. Either 
			slash will work in Windows but Linux only accepts the Unix style
			path else throws an error.

	<p>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.4:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			user-info.php - Added XSS defenses to the output so that users cannot poison 
			their username, password or signature to cause XSS.
			This only works in secure code.
		</li>
		<li>
			register.php - Added XSS defenses to the output so that users cannot poison 
			their username to cause XSS. This only works in secure code.
		</li>
		<li>
			header.php - Added link to this changelog. Changed style of upper header to 
			allow more space for logged in user text. In very small screens, the text was 
			overlapping. Also, the size of the mascot image was reduced to give the user 
			more screen space.
		</li>
		<li>change-log.php - Added new XSS vulnerability for users to try.

<blockquote>
	<p>Change Log for Mutillidae 2.0.3:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>index.php - Added PHP version detection and altered forms caching defenses and 
			server header information defenses to use header_remove() only if the version
			of PHP is at 5.3 or above. Made version string variable that contains whatever
			version string is for Mutillidae plus "nice" output. Samurai is going through
			a PHP version change to 5.3 right now and XAMPP just went through the same change.
			This code is meant to bridge users caught between versions.
		</li>
		<li>
			header.php - Made version output simpler. header.php only outputs the header
			string.
		</li>
		<li>
			footer.php - Added PHP version to footer output in insecure mode. In secure mode, server version is not shown.
