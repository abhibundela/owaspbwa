Release notes for the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) 
Broken Web Applications Project, a collection of vulnerable web 
applications that is distributed on a Virtual Machine in VMware format 
compatible with their no-cost and commercial VMware products. 

More information about the project can be found at 
http://www.owaspbwa.org/. 

The VM can be downloaded as a .zip file or as a much smaller .7z 7-zip 
Archive.  BOTH FILES CONTAIN THE EXACT SAME VM!  We recommend that you 
download the .7z archive if possible to save bandwidth (and time).  
7-zip is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, and other Operating Systems. 

!!! This VM has many serious security issues. We strongly recommend that 
you run it only on the "host only" or "NAT" network in the virtual machine 
settings !!!
